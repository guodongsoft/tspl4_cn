# 2.1. 和Scheme交互

Most Scheme systems provide an interactive programming environment that simplifies program development and experimentation. The simplest interaction with Scheme follows a "read-evaluate-print" cycle. A program (often called a read-evaluate-print loop, or REPL) reads each expression you type at the keyboard, evaluates it, and prints its value.

大部分Scheme实现提供了一个交互式的编程环境，简化了程序的开发和试验过程。Scheme的交互环境叫做"读-执行-打印-循环"，通常简称为"read-evaluate-print-loop“，即：REPL。针对你每次通过键盘输入的表达式，它都会执行下列步骤，先读取该表达式，并对它求值，然后打印其结果。

With an interactive Scheme system, you can type an expression at the keyboard and see its value immediately. You can define a procedure and apply it to arguments to see how it works. You can even type in an entire program consisting of a set of procedure definitions and test it without leaving the system. When your program starts getting longer, it will be more convenient to type it into a file (using a text editor), load the file and test it interactively. In most Scheme systems, a file may be loaded with the nonstandard procedure load, which takes a string argument naming the file. Preparing your program in a file has several advantages: you have a chance to compose your program more carefully, you can correct errors without retyping the program, and you can retain a copy for later use. Most Scheme implementations treat expressions loaded from a file the same as expressions typed at the keyboard.

在一个交互式的Scheme环境中，你可以通过键盘输入一个表达式，并可以立即看到它的求值结果。你可以定义一个过程，并传递参数去调用它，观察它是如何执行的。你甚至可以输入一个由一组过程定义组成的完整程序，并在不离开交互环境的情况下直接测试它。当你的程序变得很长时，把它保存在文件里（通过文本编辑器）比较方便一些，然后加载它进行交互测试。在大部分Scheme实现里，文件可以被一个名叫"load”的非标准过程加载，它接受一个字符串形式的文件名作为参数。把你的程序保存到文件里有几个好处：你有机会更仔细的编写你的程序，你可以不用重新输入程序就可以修改错误，并且可以保留一个备份以便以后使用。大部分Scheme实现，对表达式的处理方式是一致的，无论是从文件加载还是从键盘输入的。

While Scheme provides various input and output procedures, the REPL takes care of reading expressions and printing their values. This frees you to concentrate on writing your program without worrying about how its results will be displayed.

Scheme提过了各种输入输出过程，REPL接手了表达式的读取和求值的工作，这可以让你专注于代码的编写，而不用操心如何显示其结果。

The examples in this chapter and in the rest of the book follow a regular format. An expression you might type from your keyboard is given first, possibly spanning several lines. The value of the expression is given after the =>, to be read as "evaluates to." The => is omitted for definitions and when the value of an expression is unspecified.

本章和书中后面部分的示例代码遵循一个通用格式。首先，从键盘输入表达式，它可能跨越多行。然后表达式的结果跟在“=>"之后，它被读作"执行结果为"。define表达式和没有结果值的表达式可以顺略"=>"。

The example programs are formatted in a style that "looks nice" and conveys the structure of the program. The code is easy to read because the relationship between each expression and its subexpressions is clearly shown. Scheme ignores indentation and line breaks, however, so there is no need to follow a particular style. The important thing is to establish one style and keep to it. Scheme sees each program as if it were on a single line, with its subexpressions ordered from left to right.

示例代码采用了一种"易于阅读"的编写格式，使程序的结构清晰明了。因为每个表达式和它的子表达式的关系被清晰的展示出来，代码比较容易阅读。Scheme无视缩进和换行符，因此不需要遵循某个特定的格式。重要的是，要确立并保持一致的编程风格。对于Scheme来说，它视每个程序为一行由其子表达式从左到右依次排列的语句。

If you have access to an interactive Scheme system, it might be a good idea to start it up now and type in the examples as you read. One of the simplest Scheme expressions is a string constant. Try typing "Hi Mom!" (including the double quotes) in response to the prompt. The system should respond with "Hi Mom!"; the value of any constant is the constant itself.

"Hi Mom!" => "Hi Mom!"

Here is a set of expressions, each with Scheme's response. They are explained in later sections of this chapter, but for now use them to practice interacting with Scheme.

"hello" => "hello"
42 => 42
22/7 => 22/7
3.141592653 => 3.141592653
+ => #<procedure>
(+ 76 31) => 107
(* -12 10) => -120
'(a b c d) => (a b c d)

Be careful not to miss any single quotes ( ' ), double quotes, or parentheses. If you left off a single quote in the last expression, you probably received a message indicating that an exception has occurred. Just try again. If you left off a closing parenthesis or double quote, the system might still be waiting for it.

Here are a few more expressions to try. You can try to figure out on your own what they mean or wait to find out later in the chapter.

(car '(a b c)) => a
(cdr '(a b c)) => (b c)
(cons 'a '(b c)) => (a b c)
(cons (car '(a b c))
      (cdr '(d e f))) => (a e f)

As you can see, Scheme expressions may span more than one line. The Scheme system knows when it has an entire expression by matching double quotes and parentheses.

Next, let's try defining a procedure.

(define square
  (lambda (n)
    (* n n)))

The procedure square computes the square n2 of any number n. We say more about the expressions that make up this definition later in this chapter. For now it suffices to say that define establishes variable bindings, lambda creates procedures, and * names the multiplication procedure. Note the form of these expressions. All structured forms are enclosed in parentheses and written in prefix notation, i.e., the operator precedes the arguments. As you can see, this is true even for simple arithmetic operations such as *.

Try using square.

(square 5) => 25
(square -200) => 40000
(square 0.5) => 0.25
(square -1/2) => 1/4

Even though the next definition is short, you might enter it into a file. Let's assume you call the file "reciprocal.ss."

(define reciprocal
  (lambda (n)
    (if (= n 0)
        "oops!"
        (/ 1 n))))

This procedure, reciprocal, computes the quantity 1/n for any number n ≠ 0. For n = 0, reciprocal returns the string "oops!". Return to Scheme and try loading your file with the procedure load.

(load "reciprocal.ss")

Finally, try using the procedure we have just defined.

(reciprocal 10) => 1/10
(reciprocal 1/10) => 10
(reciprocal 0) => "oops!"
(reciprocal (reciprocal 1/10)) => 1/10

In the next section we will discuss Scheme expressions in more detail. Throughout this chapter, keep in mind that your Scheme system is one of the most useful tools for learning Scheme. Whenever you try one of the examples in the text, follow it up with your own examples. In an interactive Scheme system, the cost of trying something out is relatively small---usually just the time to type it in.
